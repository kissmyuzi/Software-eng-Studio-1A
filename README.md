### Purpose
This team is being formed in order to create a fully functional and smooth application for android devices. The application will be used to benefit those communities in need with free notes and tutors that will be able to help underprivileged students to achieve their full potential in school. Our team is aiming to develop an easy to use and smooth experience for its users in order to not cause any frustration for the user. 

Our current plan will allow those underprivileged students to also take advantage of tutors by meeting face to face with them at their own selected times and places. If the students parents do not feel comfortable in meeting at their home they may choose to go to the local library or park and learn there. 
These features will only be accessible through the means of a valid student email. Using this method we will be more easily able to identify if the individual attempting to register is part of the community and not just any student from any school (It is still being decided whether or not to allow any individual to access the notes for free, the students are the only ones who will have access to the tutors).

### Scope
For students who are in need of educational resources such as subject notes or tutors, this android application will provide a platform to connect with tutors who can provide these resources. Students and tutors will be able to access the application by registration of their unique student email. Each tutor will further undergo a screening process in order to make sure they are suitable to be tutors for these communities. Students, once registered, can search for resources filtered by course name or tutor name. The search results can be ranked in order of rating, popularity and relevance. Students can view tutor profiles, which will contain details such as reviews, course history, and all notes uploaded by the respective tutor. Tutors, once registered, can upload and tag notes, and book tutoring appointments with  students through in-app booking management. The system will manage the appointment data for students and tutors for the selected date and times. Databases will be created to store appointment and profile data. 

Our mission is to work effectively as a team to identify and apply programming skills and problem-solving methodologies in order to develop a large-scale project based on the specified software requirements. This application will be addressing the education needs of disadvantaged or underperforming student communities with the goal of bridging the education gap by providing access to academic resources. Closing this capability gap will result in higher academic performance and increased student morale, reflecting positively on economic growth and quality of life. These mission needs are dependent on the participation of both student and tutors to provide and demand the resources exchanged, and the development of a fully functional, seamless and easy-to-use application. It will be necessary to place importance on regular maintenance and quick response to user feedback and most importantly, data security.

In order to achieve this mission, the high level goals which the team must accomplish are:
Ease of accessibility and usage: to cater to a variety of technical skill levels.
Highly efficient security protocols: to ensure data security and avoid legal repercussions.
Fully functional features: key functions listed above must perform to their requirement.
Communication and cohesive teamwork: in order to ensure seamless development.
